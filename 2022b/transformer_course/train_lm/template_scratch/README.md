# Steps for training Transformer LM from scratch
Refer: [huggingface course: Training a causal language model from scratch](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/6).
1. Gathering the data
2. Preparing the dataset
3. Initializing a new model
4. Code generation with a pipeline
5. Training with Accelerate

TODO: <br>
Currently the example codes is for training language models for programming languages generation. <br>
Let's make example codes for other purposes.
