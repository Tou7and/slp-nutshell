# Response
For this sentiment analysis task, I will train two models: a baseline model using a simple bag-of-words approach with logistic regression, and another model using a pre-trained language model such as BERT.
To visualize the performance of these models, I will use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced evaluation of the model's performance. I will use these metrics to evaluate the performance of the models on the test set.
For the baseline model, I will use a simple bag-of-words approach with logistic regression. This involves representing each document in the corpus as a vector of word frequencies, and then using logistic regression to classify the sentiment of each document. This approach is a common baseline in sentiment analysis tasks and can provide a good starting point for more complex models.
For the second model, I will use a pre-trained language model such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT is a state-of-the-art language model that has achieved high performance on a wide range of natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis. BERT is trained on a large corpus of text and can be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis.
Here is some sample code to train and evaluate the baseline model using Python and scikit-learn:
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score

# Load the data
train_data = pd.read_csv("train_data.csv")
test_data = pd.read_csv("test_data.csv")

# Create a bag-of-words representation of the data
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_data["text"])
y_train = train_data["sentiment"]
X_test = vectorizer.transform(test_data["text"])
y_test = test_data["sentiment"]

# Train a logistic regression model
clf = LogisticRegression()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
precision = precision_score(y_test, y_pred)
recall = recall_score(y_test, y_pred)
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Print the evaluation metrics
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1 score:", f1)
```

To train and evaluate the BERT model, we can use a pre-trained BERT model from the Hugging Face Transformers library and fine-tune it on our sentiment analysis task. Here is some sample code to do this:
```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import torch
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification, AdamW

# Load the data
train_data = pd.read_csv("train_data.csv")
test_data = pd.read_csv("test_data.csv")

# Initialize the tokenizer and the pre-trained BERT model
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
model = BertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)

# Tokenize the data
train_inputs = tokenizer(list(train_data["text"]), padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512, return_tensors="pt")
train_labels = torch.tensor(train_data["sentiment"].values)
test_inputs = tokenizer(list(test_data["text"]), padding=True, truncation=True, max_length=512, return_tensors="pt")
test_labels = torch.tensor(test_data["sentiment"].values)

# Fine-tune the model on the training set
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)
model.train()
for epoch in range(3):
optimizer.zero_grad()
outputs = model(**train_inputs, labels=train_labels)
loss = outputs.loss
loss.backward()
optimizer.step()

# Evaluate the model on the test set
model.eval()
with torch.no_grad():
outputs = model(**test_inputs)
logits = outputs.logits
predictions = np.argmax(logits.detach().numpy(), axis=1)

accuracy = accuracy_score(test_labels, predictions)
precision = precision_score(test_labels, predictions)
recall = recall_score(test_labels, predictions)
f1 = f1_score(test_labels, predictions)

# Print the evaluation metrics
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Precision:", precision)
print("Recall:", recall)
print("F1 score:", f1)
```
